# MovieFreak
A simple Fun program which scraps data about the movie you searched
this piece of code searches your movie name in the google and scraps the google information of the website beside showing it to you
it saves the data to a csv format file at the directory of the program.
the program is still at development and hasn't been completed so there are lots of polishing to be done.
